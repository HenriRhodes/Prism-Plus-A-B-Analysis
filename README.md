# Prism-Plus-A-B-Analysis
This project was completed during a 10 week data experience accelerator. Using BigQuery, SQL, Python, Excel and Power BI I interrogated  an historically accurate dataset from a fast fashion e-commerce company. One of the presentations shown below was an analysis of a loyalty scheme A/B test. The test customer base had been split into tiers on the premise of count of products bought prior to the start of the A/B. 


Below is the Executive summary of my findings
